Your Privacy Comes First.
We believe your data is yours and yours alone. This policy outlines our commitment to keeping your information safe, private, and under your control.

Data Collection and Storage
Key Takeaway: Your personal data is primarily stored on your device. We only collect and process specific information when you choose to use our optional services like Cloud Sync or the AI Coach.

Momentum AI is designed with your privacy at its core. We are transparent about the data we handle and give you full control over it.

What data is stored on my device?
The following information is stored locally on your device:

Habit Tracking Data: All habits, daily logs, goals, and progress.

Task Management Data: All tasks, projects, and planning information.

Gamification Data: Your XP, level, and badges.

Health and Activity Data: Sleep duration, screen time, and other data collected with your explicit permission.

What data is sent to the cloud?
When you choose to enable Cloud Sync, the data listed above is securely backed up to your private Firebase account to ensure it's protected and available across your devices.

What data is used by the AI?
The AI Coach operates by processing your local habit and daily log data to provide personalized insights and correlations.

Third-Party Access
Key Takeaway: We do not sell your data or share it for advertising purposes. We only use essential services to run the app.

We use the following third-party services, which may process some data on our behalf:

Firebase Authentication: Used for secure sign-in with Google, email, or for anonymous accounts. We collect your name and email address if you use these services to manage your account.

Google Fit / Health Connect: If you opt-in to automatic sleep tracking, we access sleep duration data from Health Connect to populate your daily log.

Generative AI Service: The AI Coach feature uses a generative AI model to process your local data and provide conversational insights. Your data is sent to this service, but it is not retained or used to train the model.

User Control and App Permissions
Key Takeaway: You are always in control of your data.

Permissions: The app may request permissions for Local Notifications to send you reminders and for Health Data to track your sleep with your explicit consent.

Data Deletion: You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from the app's settings.

Policy Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect any changes in our practices or to comply with evolving legal requirements. When updates occur, we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on this page. We strongly encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about how your data is handled.
