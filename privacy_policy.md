Privacy Policy for HabitFlow AI
This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the HabitFlow AI mobile application. Our commitment is to your privacy, with a core design philosophy centered on keeping your data local and secure.

Data Collection and Storage
HabitFlow AI is fundamentally designed with your privacy at its core. This application does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers or integrate with third-party services for data handling. Your information remains exclusively on your device, under your full control.

All data you input into the HabitFlow AI app, ensuring complete privacy and user control, includes:

Your habit names and their clear descriptions.

Your detailed habit progress, encompassing completion status and active streaks.

Your configured habit frequency settings (e.g., daily, weekly, or custom cycles).

Your defined target times for habits and the structured schedule for your activities.

Your activity planning data, enabling efficient organization of your tasks.

Your activity completion status, including precise on-time checks for enhanced accountability.

Your personal app preferences, such as your chosen interface theme (light/dark mode).

All of this information is stored solely on your local device's storage (utilizing secure local storage mechanisms like SharedPreferences in Android). This data is never exposed to the app developer or any other external entity; it remains entirely private and contained within your device.

Crucially, the AI integration that provides predictions and smart suggestions operates entirely by processing the data already present locally on your device. Absolutely no personal habit or activity data is transmitted to external servers for any AI processing.

No Third-Party Access
HabitFlow AI adheres to a strict policy against third-party data integration. We do not incorporate or utilize any third-party analytics tools, advertising SDKs, or other services that could potentially collect, transmit, or process your personal data. Your usage and habit data are retained exclusively within the confines of your device, ensuring maximum privacy.

No Personal Information Sharing
Given our unwavering commitment to not collecting or storing your personal information on our servers or via third-party services, it is our definitive policy that we do not share your data with anyone. Your data remains entirely on your device, under your complete and direct control.

Permissions
The HabitFlow AI app may request specific permissions from your device to enable its core functionalities. For instance, it might require permission for local notifications to deliver timely habit reminders, or access to your device's calendar if you opt for integrated activity planning. These permissions are requested and utilized strictly for the essential operation of the app on your device and do not grant us any means to access, collect, or transmit any personal data from your device for external use.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect any changes in our practices or to comply with evolving legal requirements. When updates occur, we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on this page. We strongly encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about how your data is handled.
